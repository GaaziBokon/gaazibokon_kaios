# gaazibokon_kaios
GaaziBokon client for KaiOS

Note that this KaiOS client ignores key layout sent from server and offers user a choice from these layouts:
 - WASD + QER
 - Arrow keys + Space
 - Arrow keys + Enter

Pressing `*` will send `Volume up` signal while `#` does the opposite.
Triple pressing `0` within a second will send the `Kill` signal which asks GB server to terminate the current focused window.


## How to install?

You need to sideload the app using WebIDE or tools like gdeploy on your device. [Find more information on how to enter debugging mode and sideloading on BananaHackers wiki](https://wiki.bananahackers.net/en/install-omnisd)
